        <h3>Pricing</h3>

        <p>We pay $2000 per bedroom in rent to our landlord, and we split that cost evenly based on the number of people living in each room. We also each pay a membership fee of $350, which covers the costs of food, utilities, supplies, discounted rates for residents who take on leadership roles in areas such as recruitment and food and supplies procurement, as well as rent on any temporarily unoccupied beds. It works out as follows: </p>

        <dl>
          <dt>3-person room</dt>
          <dd> $667 rent + $350 membership fee = $1,017 monthly per person</dd>

          <dt>2-person room</dt>
          <dd>$1,000 rent + $350 membership fee = $1,350 monthly per person</dd>

          <dt>1-person room</dt>
          <dd>$2,000 rent + $350 membership fee = $2,350 monthly per person</dd>
        </dl>
