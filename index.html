</h2>
<p>We're a community of 40 people living together in one of the greatest places on earth - San Francisco's Mission District. We value presence, mindfulness, sustainability, collaboration and transformative experiences and strive to exemplify those values in our daily lives.</p>

<h3>Our Community</h3>

<h3>Building Community Through Food</h3>
<p>We all participate in a shared food plan, sourcing local, organic fruits, veggies, meats, cheeses as well as staples like pasta and rice. Weekly deliveries keep us stocked up, and we try to get together to cook and eat with one another as often as we can.</p>

<h3>Affordable Living</h3>
<p>Because we live in one of the most expensive neighborhoods on earth, many residents share rooms. Furnished singles, doubles and triples are available at medium term and long term rates. For more information on pricing please <a href="pricing">click here.</a></p>

<h3>Our Space</h3>
<p>We share 4 beautiful, recently renovated apartments in a classic San Francisco Victorian. We look for housemates with similar standards of cleanliness and strive to keep our space someplace we all look forward to coming home to. Check out pictures of our space <a href="/pictures">here.</a>
